This RubyMotion code snippet goes over AVFoundation classes:

- AVCaptureSession
- AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer
- AVCaptureDevice
- AVCaptureDeviceInput

It also shows how to place a transparent layer on top of the AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer so you can “draw” using touch on the live video feed. Sort of like augmented reality.
